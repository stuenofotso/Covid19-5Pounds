# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/index.html
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: covid19-es-cluster
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
#change following the considered es-node
node.name: ec2-3-135-203-125.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com 
node.master: true
node.data: true
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: /data/elasticsearch
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /var/log/elasticsearch
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# Elasticsearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
network.host: ec2-3-135-203-125.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
#
discovery.seed_hosts: ["ec2-13-58-53-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com","ec2-3-135-203-125.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com","ec2-18-220-232-235.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com", "ec2-18-224-63-68.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com", "ec2-3-22-130-243.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com", "[::1]"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of master-eligible nodes:
#
cluster.initial_master_nodes: ["ec2-13-58-53-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com","ec2-3-135-203-125.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com","ec2-18-220-232-235.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com", "ec2-18-224-63-68.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com"]

#discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["ec2-13-58-53-1.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com","ec2-3-135-203-125.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com","ec2-18-220-232-235.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com"]
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, consult the gateway module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
