# Covid19-5Pounds
The initiative aims at defining a web-based tool supervision tool to monitor current and forecasted progressions of covid19 cases (confirmed, deaths and recoveries cases), country by country and on a daily basis. The initiative also aims at setting up   models to forecast progression in the days, weeks and months to come. The ultimate goal is to help and drive decision-making. A prototype has been implemented on the AWS cloud using the elastic stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana), Talend, Python, Spark and FBProphet and can be accessed at http://covid.fadoof.com/ (username: viewer; password: viewer).
